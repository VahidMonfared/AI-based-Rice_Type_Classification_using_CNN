# **Rice Type Classification**
----------------------
## **Context**
----------------------
Rice forms the staple ingredient for meals across multiple countries all over the world. Rice provides 21% of global human per capita energy and 15% of per capita protein. For several Asian nations, rice is also very important from a business perspective. India had the highest export volume of rice worldwide, at 18.75 million metric tons as of 2021/2022.  It exports non-Basmati rice to African countries and Basmati to the Middle East. Vietnam was the second-largest rice exporter, with about 6.5 million metric tons of rice worldwide in that year.
Deep learning algorithms have recently seen numerous applications in the field of agriculture, specifically in crop identification. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be utilized to identify the different rice types, as classifying rice into its true type becomes a very necessary step in agricultural export businesses globally.
---------------------
## **Objective**
---------------------
The project aims to build a Neural Network to differentiate among 5 different rice types, namely Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag.
----------------------
## **Dataset**
----------------------
The dataset is a folder consisting of close to 75000 images split into 3 folders namely, train, validation, and test. Each of these three folders has 5 sub-folders that are named after the 5 types of rice we are going to be studying here, i.e., Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag.
